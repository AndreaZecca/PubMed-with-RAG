            "question": "In a population of giraffes, an environmental change occurs that favors individuals that are tallest. As a result, more of the taller individuals are able to obtain nutrients and survive to pass along their genetic information. This is an example of\n(A) directional selection.\n(B) stabilizing selection.\n(C) sexual selection.\n(D) disruptive selection.\n",
            "response": "The answer is (D) disruptive selection.\n\nIn disruptive selection, two extreme phenotypes are favored over intermediate phenotypes. In the case of the giraffes, the environmental change favored the tallest and short",

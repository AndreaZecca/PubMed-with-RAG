Muscular contractions of the calf, along with the one-way venous valves, are then required to promote venous return to the heart. Flow also can be increased by leg elevation or compression and decreased by sud-den elevation of intra-abdominal pressure (Valsalva maneuver).

For long-term administration of O2, a nasal cannula is the most widely used device, as it enables patients to eat and speak unhindered by the O2 delivery system. Though nasal cannula is the easiest way to provide supplemental O2, the actual fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) delivered to the patient can be quite variable and affected by the child\u2019s size and respiratory pattern. Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) allows the provider to more comfortably deliver higher flow rates while controlling the FIO2 and is now widely used in neonates as an alternative to noninvasive positive pressure.

Oxygen saturation is monitored by pulse oximetry. Supplemental oxygen can be given in graduated, rising percentages to maintain oxygen saturation values within a normal range per minute of life.

Consequently, the airway pressure may exceed the inspiratory pressure limit, the ventilator-assisted breath will be aborted, and minute volume may drop below that programmed by the operator.

These differences in oxygen tension have profound effects on arterial blood gas values.\n\nAs inspiration begins, ambient air is brought into the nasopharynx and laryngopharynx, where it becomes warmed to body temperature and humidified. Inspired air becomes saturated with water vapor by the time it reaches the glottis. Water vapor exerts a partial pressure and dilutes the total pressure in which the other gases are distributed. Water vapor pressure at body temperature is 47 mm Hg.

During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report.

The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database is an outcomes reporting tool capable of validating the use of surgical checklists.", "an error of surgical technique or postoperative management was found in eleven patients (17%). In six cases (9%) the indication was inappropriate or there was an obvious contraindication. The indication was questionable in fourteen (21.5%). Half of the patients (52.5%) had surgery for an appropriate indication, and no contraindication or error in surgical technique or management was identified.", "Graft rupture of the same knee or injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the contralateral knee is a devastating outcome after ACL reconstruction surgery. While a number of factors have been identified as potentially increasing the risk of subsequent ACL injury, the literature is far from definitive.", "It is a well-established dogma that many surgeons do not reach a quintessential level of their technical operative skills until successful completion of their training program. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that early introduction of supervised residents to non-complex spinal surgical procedures within a structured and supervised educational program does not harm the patient in terms of higher complication rates or worse pain- and health-related quality of life (HrQOL) outcomes."]}, {"question": "A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear.

Two days later, the patient presented with hearing loss, severe nausea and vomiting, acute renal failure as well as elevated liver enzymes. In addition, she developed a severe myelodepression. After plasmapheresis on two consecutive days and vigorous supportive treatment, the toxicity-related symptoms improved and the patient recovered without any sequelae.", "Cisplatin is a DNA-damaging drug used for treatment of testicular tumors. The toxicity of cisplatin probably results from its ability to form DNA adducts that inhibit polymerases. Blocked replication represents a particular challenge for tumor cells, which are committed to unremitting division. Recombination provides a mechanism by which replication can proceed despite the presence of lesions and therefore could be significant for managing cisplatin toxicity.", "Prostate cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death, and drug resistance is the leading reason for therapy failure. However, how this occurs is largely unknown.
